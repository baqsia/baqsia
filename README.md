# 👋 Hi, I'm Bakar

**Senior Software Engineer | AI-Driven Engineer | Modernization Enthusiast**

Across multiple complex products and platforms, I’ve focused on building and evolving software that actually survives real-world constraints: legacy systems, messy domains, and the need to keep shipping while everything changes underneath.

I care about strong engineering foundations, enabling technical teams, and solving hard problems with pragmatic, well-reasoned solutions rather than hype.

## 🛠 What I Do

- 🏛 **High-Level Architecture & System Design**  
  Designing modular, scalable systems using patterns like Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, and event-driven architectures.

- 🔍 **Complex Software Engineering**  
  Refactoring legacy codebases, redesigning critical paths, and building greenfield components that integrate cleanly with what already exists.

- 🌍 **Cloud-Ready & Distributed Systems**  
  Architecting and implementing services that are secure, observable, and ready to scale.

- ⚡ **Modernization & Refactoring**  
  Turning monoliths and legacy platforms into cleaner, more maintainable, and extensible systems—without breaking the business.

- 🖥️ Hands-On **Coding & Delivery**  
  Writing production-grade code, mentoring engineers, and owning features from design to deployment.

- 🚀 **Product Evolution & Innovation**  
  Moving existing products forward safely—introducing new capabilities, improving reliability, and reducing long-term technical risk.

## 🤖 How I Use AI

I treat AI as a practical force multiplier, not a replacement for engineering:

- Validating architectural approaches and trade-offs  
- Accelerating refactoring and code review workflows  
- Improving documentation, design clarity, and feedback loops  
- Boosting engineering productivity while maintaining code quality
