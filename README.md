Software Engineer | AI-Driven Engineer | Software Enthusiast

With an extensive journey across complex, long-lived software systems, I focus on transforming legacy platforms into scalable, secure, and future-ready architectures. My work spans designing end-to-end systems, leading technical teams, and delivering modernization initiatives that balance business continuity with long-term evolution.

I’m deeply committed to empowering engineering teams—helping them navigate architectural complexity, make sound technical decisions, and confidently tackle high-impact challenges.

🛠 What I Do

🏛 High-Level Architecture & System Design — Modular monoliths, DDD, CQRS, event-driven systems

🔍 Complex Software Engineering — From legacy refactoring to greenfield platforms

☁️ Cloud-Ready Architectures — Security, scalability, and operational excellence

⚡ Modernization & Refactoring — Turning legacy systems into maintainable, extensible solutions

🖥️ Hands-On Engineering — Production-grade code, not just diagrams

🚀 Innovation & Evolution — Moving existing products forward without breaking them

I actively use AI as a force multiplier in my daily workflow—for architectural analysis, refactoring strategies, documentation, and accelerating engineering feedback loops.
