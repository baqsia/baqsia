# 👋 Hi there

**Software Architect | Tech Lead | AI-Driven Engineer | Modernization Enthusiast**

I focus on designing, evolving, and modernizing complex software systems. My work centers on transforming legacy platforms into scalable, secure, and maintainable architectures while ensuring business continuity and long-term growth.

I care deeply about building strong engineering foundations, enabling technical teams, and solving hard problems with pragmatic, well-reasoned solutions.
